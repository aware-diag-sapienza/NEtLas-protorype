NetLas: Toward an integrated atlas for exploration and analysis ofnetwork medicine data	Alessia Palleschi and Marco Angelini	11th EG Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine			teaser	.png										Network medicine typically involves analyzing data related to several topics (e.g., genes, diseases, and drugs) to investigatehow they interact together. These connections come from different heterogeneous data sources, leading to a series of problemsthat need to be addressed to perform meaningful analyses, such as the integration of these data, the evaluation of their quality,and the capability to conduct exploratory data analysis on them. To mitigate these problems, we present our on-going researchactivities on NetLas  a NETwork medicine atLAS exploiting Visual Analytics based on multilayer visualization and analysis.NetLas provides a complete overview of genes data, which allows the user to easily navigate the data and conduct deeperinvestigations on diseases and drugs. In particular, we have integrated several data sources to offer an integrated view. We havecharacterized the quality of information and ranked the interactions' reliability. Finally, we have designed a fully explorablevisual environment, with additional analytics to help the user in her investigation activities.
